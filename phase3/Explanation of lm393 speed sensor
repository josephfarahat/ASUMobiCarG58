Note that one side of the optical sensor holds s a light emitting diode, and a photo transistor on the other side.
If the visual path is not blocked, phototransistor would conduct,
but when something blocked the light falling on the photo transistor it wouldnâ€™t conduct.
So an encoder disc (with a proper encoder resolution) can be placed in the slot of the optical sensor to count rotation rate of a connected wheel.
The encoder disc (also known as index wheel)  have multiple slots/holes. 
You can easily fabricate your own encoder disk from a sheet of stainless steel or hard plastic. 
If you are interested only in speed sensing (not position sensing) application , one set of slots is sufficient for the task.
Our disk has 12 slots.
Diameter of the wheel is 20.4 cm
Each revolution of the wheel is equivalent to 12 interruptions.
Each interuption signifies a motion of 1.7 cm which is also the resolution of our accurate movement.
