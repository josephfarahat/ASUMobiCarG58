Phase two
Components :
3 IR sensors.
Basic idea :
Each IR sensor detects white and black colors.
One sensor is on the left one on the right and one centered.
If the left(right) sensor detects a black line the car turn to the left(right).
If the three sensors detect a black line the car continues in the same state as before. 
This idea is used to make a line tracking vehicle .
